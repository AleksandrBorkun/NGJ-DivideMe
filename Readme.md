# Divide Me

it's a isometric/puzzle game (could be voxel world in a small neighborhood)

The idea is that first you create you character , select skills and abiliy and in general budig your avatar

And then game started, you might be go for a walk or whatever, and you being kidnapped by aliens. But they small. And so the decided to split you on small pieces. Each piece of you have some uniq ability or skill.
Since now you mecame a mess of small pieces aliens don't know how to investigate you. So the decided to put you back, and before they do, that instruct you that you can became you real shape again when you xolloect all your parts.

So you sent back, I'm buch of small pieces spread on a map. And your mission is to collect yourself again

## Limitations:

Parts controlled by "brain"
"Brain power" is how many parts you can controll at a time (can represent number of players)

When part is not controlled it can randomly moved by map, so you need to make sure to lock it somehow
